# HebiEbi (A WaniKani like site but for absolute beginners)

This website is ment for people who want to learn japanese, but have
not had the oppertunity to learn hiragana and katakana, which is must
before starting WaniKani.

This project should also serve as a simple introduction on how django works.

Features:
- SRL (Spaced Repetition Learning )? or what it is called.
- Account creation, to see your own progress.
- 10 Levels for Hiragana
- 13 Levels for Katakana

Need to teach about dakuten " が in the top right changes the ka to a ga.

And maybe some common words that also only use hiragana or katakana.
